# CordicSimulator

*CORDIC (COordinate Rotating DIgital Computer) Simulator*

This is a simulator of COordinate Rotating DIgital Computer. The CORDIC 
architecture can easily be leveraged to do a handful of trigonometric calculus.
It can be used to numerically solve different trig functions which makes the
algorithm useful in CAD software where the same operation need be applied to
thousand of vertices at the same time.

This project is a visual simulator of the algorithm programmed in C# and Winforms.
You can see step by step -and even substeps- how the result is being calculated.
It is intended as an academic help for teaching the algorithm.
